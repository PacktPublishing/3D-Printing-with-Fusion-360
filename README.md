**Design for additive manufacturing, and level up your simulation and print preparation skills**

## What is this book about?

If you're a designer using Autodesk Fusion on a daily basis and want to delve into 3D printing or craft functional, lightweight prints, this book is your go-to. It's also a valuable reference for intermediate-level Fusion users seeking insights into DFAM (design for additive manufacturing) and print preparation.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Use Autodesk Fusion to open, inspect, repair, and edit externally created designs for 3D printing
* Set up your 3D prints for different printing technologies, such as FFF, SLA/DLP, SLS, and MPBF
* Use templates to automate your additive operations, including part orientation, arrangement, and support
* Run process simulation for metal powder bed fusion and learn how to compensate for common print failure modes
* Optimize Fusion 360’s preferences for 3D printing
* Export machine-specific file formats for 3D printing, such as G-Code, SLI, SLC, and CLI
